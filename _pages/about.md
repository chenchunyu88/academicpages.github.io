I am a Quantitative Genetist working on Whole Genome Prediction (WGP) and genome-wide association (GWA) models using traditional genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP), hierarchical Bayesian models, or machine learning and achieved great success in animal and plant breeding. My research focus is on developing scalable software tools for WGP and GWA.

Other section is still under development!!!!
